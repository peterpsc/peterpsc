Personal Note:
I used to be a Mechanical Engineer and then a Software Engineer.
I was bitten by a tick ~2006 and it wasn't treated correctly.  
My condition declined and I went for treatment with a Lyme Specialist in 2016.
That week, my ability to read went away!  I could read each word, but couldn't understand the sentences.
This year my reading started coming back after I lost ~55lbs on a special diet by Optavia.
This is my first attempt at programming since 2016.  
It is very slow work, but I have been taking advantage of youtube videos for tutorials instead of reading, and my reading is progressively getting better.
